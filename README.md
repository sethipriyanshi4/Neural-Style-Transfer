# Neural-Style-Transfer
This repository contains experiments run to explore the different facets of neural style transfer. 

Neural style transfer is used as an optimization technique that combines two different images—a content image and a style reference image—to produce an output image that retains the appearance of the content image but has been modified to match the actual style of the style reference image.
This is achieved by fine-tuning the output image to match the style reference images and the statistics for both content and style in the content image. These statistics are extracted from the images using a convolutional network.
